1
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:15,540
They called me Lilya Lungina

2
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:24,368
Between ages five to ten, when I lived in Germany, I was called Lili Markovich

3
00:01:24,382 --> 00:01:31,431
Then, from ten to fourteen, in France, they called me Lilia Markovich

4
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:37,177
In my mother's puppet show, I was called Lili Imali

5
00:01:37,185 --> 00:01:44,273
Imali is mother's pseudonym, Ancient Hebrew for "my mom"

6
00:01:47,512 --> 00:01:52,116
That's how many names I used to have...

7
00:01:52,236 --> 00:01:54,414
... and just as many schools.

8
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:57,804
I went to -- I counted once -- twelve different schools

9
00:01:57,924 --> 00:02:06,311
But during this long life -- my birthday will be on July 16 [1997]

10
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:10,244
It's terrifying. I'd never think that one could live so long

11
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:14,177
I still haven't gotten used to calling myself by my name and patronym

12
00:02:14,297 --> 00:02:22,135
Nevertheless, seventy-seven years is a lot. And it's time to sum up.

13
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:28,355
And on the other hand, how do you summarize an activity, a vocation?

14
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:31,465
How do you summarize life?

15
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,666
I think, that the summary of life is life itself.

16
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:45,276
All the happy, difficult, miserable, blazing, and faded moments, the collection of minutes, hours, days...

17
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:53,966
... so to speak the essence of life -- that is the sum of life, and the sum of life cannot be anything else.

18
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:58,209
That's why, now, I'd like to reminisce.

19
00:03:14,673 --> 00:03:24,091
I remember very clearly the moment I first understood that I'm me, that is, that I'm separate from the rest of the world.

20
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:29,488
I have a photograph where I'm sitting on father's lap...

21
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:40,281
... it seemed, that until that minute, I felt a unity with him and the world. And then it was suddenly as if I contrasted myself with him, and with everything that was around me.

22
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:46,867
I think, from that moment, I saw in myself an individual, a person.

23
00:03:46,987 --> 00:03:55,373
Before then, I grew (so to speak) according to my genes and my inborn template.

24
00:03:55,493 --> 00:04:05,801
But from that moment, as soon as I found myself facing the world, it began to affect me.

25
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:13,759
And the innate in me gradually started to undergo changes, processing, polishing —

26
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:20,029
impacts of the outside world, of that big life that surrounded me.

27
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:33,932
In other words my experience, what I experienced, the situations I found myself in, choices I made, relationships I had with people...

28
00:04:34,052 --> 00:04:41,799
... contained a large and ever-increasing element of the world that raged around me.

29
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:49,665
So I thought that by telling my life, I will tell not so much about myself,

30
00:04:49,785 --> 00:04:54,238
because that idea seemed bizarre to me: what would I speak about myself for?

31
00:04:54,358 --> 00:05:07,501
But to speak of myself as an organism that had absorbed elements of the surrounding life,

32
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:13,355
a complicated life, contradictory to the life of the surrounding world,

33
00:05:13,475 --> 00:05:22,045
then that other, big life, passed through itself -- something objective -- can be experienced.

34
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:25,013
And perhaps, objectively, something valuable.

35
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:35,349
If art, say a movie, must carry a message --

36
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:43,673
a message for humanity -- and if every such testament should also have a message,

37
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:46,234
then I would like to formulate my "message" right away.

38
00:05:46,354 --> 00:05:51,539
Most of all, I would like to impart that it's necessary to hope and to believe,

39
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:59,588
that even very bad situations can turn around.

40
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:04,253
I will show that in my, and then in Sima's and my life

41
00:06:04,373 --> 00:06:07,912
many misfortunes turned into incredible, amazing happiness, richness,

42
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:15,961
I will try to emphasize this, to show that one needn't despair.

43
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:22,500
Because I know that these days there is much despair in people's souls.

44
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:30,732
And so, we must believe and hope, and gradually things can turn around.

45
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:47,197
I think that in the years when mother and father were alive,

46
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:55,886
almost all of Poltava (except downtown), with its magnificent provincial buildings, looked like this.

47
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:04,393
I imagine that my mother live in a little house just like this one.

48
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:12,350
I know they had a two-story house. The first floor was wooden, and the second was made of plaster.

49
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,747
A pharmacy occupied the first floor. It wasn't just a pharmacy,

50
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:21,497
as for some reason grandfather also sold toys there.

51
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:26,299
The pharmacy had a large toy department.

52
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:29,592
Grandfather was not only the owner of the pharmacy,

53
00:07:29,712 --> 00:07:37,093
but was also a pharmacist, chemist, and was always preoccupied in the laboratory with some invention

54
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:43,770
— and he loved toys; he would order the latest toys from Europe and America.

55
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,160
It was said that people would come to Poltava all the way from Kiev to buy his toys.

56
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,362
Only the latest toys. He loved mechanical toys.

57
00:07:51,482 --> 00:07:54,929
Secondly, grandfather also had a medal for "Rescuing the Drowned"

58
00:07:55,049 --> 00:07:58,039
— he threw himself into the water and rescued someone.

59
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:08,192
And thirdly, grandfather was the leader of the Jewish Self-Defense Squad against pogroms.

60
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,351
Mother and father? That's a high-school romance.

61
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:23,101
Mother finished highschool in 1907.

62
00:08:23,221 --> 00:08:26,302
Maria Danilovna, her last name -- Liberson.

63
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,863
They called her Mannie.

64
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:33,954
There exists a recording of her evening graduation ceremony.

65
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:40,265
Mother and her friends, Rebeccah and Millie, finished high-school,

66
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:45,296
and the boys finished Poltava Secondary

67
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,680
with emphasis on engineering and technology.

68
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:55,540
My father was called Ziama -- Zinobiy Yakovlevich Markovich.

69
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,839
He came from a poor Jewish family,

70
00:08:59,959 --> 00:09:02,401
with something like eight or nine children.

71
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:09,718
He was the only one with higher education. The grandparents didn't ??? play a role there?

72
00:09:09,838 --> 00:09:14,109
...And so that graduation date was celebrated,

73
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:22,066
and there is a recording of the wonderful/amazing, romantically sublime plans that they had for this/their life/lives.

74
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:28,322
They didn't separate — they were separated somehow. [different words for separate?] note: maybe we should replace pronouns with their antecedents more often?

75
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:35,091
After the pogromi, grandmother and -father immigrated to Palestina

76
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:37,652
and mother didn't return to Poltava any more.

77
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:41,585
After she left them [her parents?], she returned to search for father.

78
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:48,171
Whereas (?) father finished/graduated from the Saint Petersburg Mining Institute.

79
00:09:51,281 --> 00:09:58,506
In 1907 or 1908, right after the devastations (?) of the first Russian Revolution of 1905

80
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:04,178
and that wave of pessimism that the youth grasped/caught hold of (?), especially in Saint Petersburg,

81
00:10:04,298 --> 00:10:09,208
it was as if there were a suicide epidemics; there were mass suicides.

82
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:14,239
Young kids/guys didn't know what to do with their lives, with themselves (?).

83
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:21,739
It seemed like in this country, all the hopes, perspectives/prospects to a change or movement had been lost.

84
00:10:21,859 --> 00:10:26,813
At this time my mother, who was a student at some sort of higher female courses,

85
00:10:26,933 --> 00:10:33,216
published in two or three newspapers the following announcement/open letter:

86
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:38,429
"To all boys and girls who are lonely, come to my place:

87
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:42,820
every Thursday, from 5 pm, I will open the doors of my room.

88
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:49,497
Let's socialize together, drink tea and coffee, talk, be friends.

89
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:54,070
Perhaps, together it will be easier <to live> than alone."

90
00:10:54,190 --> 00:11:05,961
According to the morals and standards of that time, this was quite a courageous, weird act, and it did not pass unnoticed.

91
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:10,611
While reading Alexander Blok's letters, I saw a reference to this;


92
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:16,354
he mentioned the courageous and strong action of the student Maria Liberson.

93
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,898
I stumbled across it quite by accident,

94
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:28,163
And it was so strange and interesting to read: I saw that my mother tried to engage very early into a/some/some sort of great life.

95
00:11:28,283 --> 00:11:34,232
She didn't live inside of her small circle,

96
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:40,385
but was open to <other> people, and that was, of course, very appealing to me/and of course I liked that very much.

97
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,518
World War I had started, father went to war, he was drafted.

98
00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:54,414
And he got captured by Germans.

99
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:57,936
For almost four years he was in captivity,

100
00:11:58,056 --> 00:12:00,604
that's why later he spoke German very well.

101
00:12:11,555 --> 00:12:16,739
During the war, mother organized a kindergarten for Jewish children,

102
00:12:16,859 --> 00:12:20,858
for the very poor, whose fathers were mobilized.

103
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:23,766
<It was> The first Jewish kindergarten.

104
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:29,222
She described it in her diaries, day by day she would write something about every child.

105
00:12:29,342 --> 00:12:32,917
It was touching; I could hardly read it without tears,

106
00:12:33,037 --> 00:12:38,930
because about some Moishes and Judiths, at first totally abstract/foreign to me,

107
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,393
she would write with so much love:

108
00:12:40,513 --> 00:12:43,789
today he pronounced such and such word correctly,

109
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:47,259
and Judith molded for the first time some kind of donkey.

110
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:51,522
All that was fixed, and it all seemed to mother extremely important,

111
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:56,453
full of content, and thus the work in the kindergarten

112
00:12:56,573 --> 00:13:00,044
(she had found two helpers/assistants)

113
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:03,746
looked like an exceptionally poetic<al> occupation/work.

114
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:09,036
It was as if she grew/cultivated rare flowers out of them.

115
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:16,632
Every one was an individual exemplar, every one was watered with special water, in a special mode,

116
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:23,619
and so gradually, as I was reading her diary, these children were flourishing/blooming:

117
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:26,902
some could sing, some learned to dance,

118
00:13:27,022 --> 00:13:30,247
some knew how to mold and read poetry.

119
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:38,273
Totally downtrodden, suppressed, they turned into small plantlets/seedlings that were lovingly brought up.

120
00:13:38,393 --> 00:13:40,148
It captivated me.

121
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:45,488
When I started to read the diary, I saw mother in a different light.

122
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:50,139
Not in the everyday one; not the mother that asks when I come home,

123
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:53,530
whether I tied the scarf and whether I ate the cutlet
[maybe insert some very common food that "English speaking" people eat? e.g. maybe sausage would fit better?]

124
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:56,866
As a general rule, mother managed the household/kept house poorly,

125
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:59,260
mother just knew how to arrange celebrations/parties (?).

126
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,895
Like setting the table for a holiday (?), preparing something extraordinary,

127
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:08,400
certainly/of course writing the menu in verse -- as much as one wants.

128
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,641
Everyday life didn't interest her.

129
00:14:13,878 --> 00:14:19,314
Father returned from captivity, as everyone else, toward the end of the war, in 1919.

130
00:14:19,434 --> 00:14:23,548
Apparently there they finally connected their lives,

131
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:27,108
although I suspect that even before father joined the army,

132
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:31,972
they certainly already had some kind of romantic relationship.

133
00:14:32,092 --> 00:14:37,439
And since father already joined some Jewish labour party,

134
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,086
that merged with the Communist party in 1917, when the communists came to power,

135
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:46,215
father found himself/became a member of the Bolshevik Party.

136
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:49,284
And right away, he got his first designation:

137
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,964
Head of Education Department in Smolensk.

138
00:14:57,703 --> 00:15:03,038
Where father and mother moved, they received a room --

139
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,947
it was a cell in the Smolensky Monastery, where they lived, and where I was born.

140
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:15,921
When I was six months old, father was one of the few Bolsheviks with higher education,

141
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:20,038
and someway (I don't know how) he was acquainted to Anatoly Lunacharsky,

142
00:15:20,158 --> 00:15:28,493
Lunacharsky summoned him to Moscow, and father became one of Lunacharsky's deputies in the Ministry of Education.

143
00:15:28,613 --> 00:15:34,745
This is how we settled down in Sretensky Boulevard in a huge house,

144
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:39,041
with fifteen or sixteen rooms in one apartment,

145
00:15:39,161 --> 00:15:44,734
twenty housewives in the kitchen and a tremendous fireplace in our room,

146
00:15:44,854 --> 00:15:51,462
on top of which, as far as I can remember, there would be always drying doll heads that were moulded out of black bead:

147
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:56,250
During the whole Moscow period, and then also later, I was accompanied (?) by dolls.

148
00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:04,383
Mother was passionate about puppet plays and wanted to create her own theatre.

149
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:09,496
Black bread was absolutely inedible, it was wet and slimy,

150
00:16:09,616 --> 00:16:12,903
and mother used it like plasticine, like clay.

151
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:23,737
When I was three or four years old, I remember how father bought me a little white goat.

152
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:29,907
We went together to the market to buy cabbage, I saw a white goat and was stunned.

153
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,301
I started to beg, said that I didn't want to part with the goat.

154
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:39,184
I hugged it, that I remember very well: how I put my arms around it, and father couldn't resist.

155
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:42,928
And so we came to mother with a live/living/real? white goat.

156
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:50,605
The first night we put it under father's desk,

157
00:16:50,725 --> 00:16:56,821
and I demanded to sleep next to it, hugging (?), under the same desk.

158
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:59,736
To the dismay/horror/consternation of our neighbors, for two or three days, the goat would be wandering from room to room --

159
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:07,157
and those were large, magnificent/luxurious apartments, apparently belonging to some pre-revolutionary rich people,

160
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:12,320
that were turned into horrible communal apartments; employees of the Ministry of Education lived there.

161
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:20,677
And so, fifteen to twenty rooms, but only one bathroom, one toilet and one kitchen --

162
00:17:20,797 --> 00:17:27,413
and right the a goat appears to revive the situtation.

163
00:17:29,793 --> 00:17:35,670
I remember myself crying when my parents gave it away to some kindergarten. I remember that well.

164
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:44,419
Strangely, I also remember how father sang when he was shaving in the mornings,

165
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:49,265
and for some reason mother would tell him: stop singing -- it's impossible to focus/concentrate.

166
00:17:49,385 --> 00:17:56,972
At that time, mother was working in some preschool/day care centers (?) and was writing reports in the mornings.

167
00:17:57,092 --> 00:18:02,850
And father would reply to her -- strange that those things stay in memory --

168
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:09,046
he'd say: I won't sing, and you will think one day: how sad that he doesn't sing any more,

169
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,532
it would be so good if he sang.

170
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:16,376
This I remember, this phrase: "it would be so good if he sang".

171
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:23,050
Another thing I remember is how we went sledding on Sretensky Boulevard,

172
00:18:23,296 --> 00:18:28,651
I remember snow-covered Moscow, because later I wouldn't see snow any more, in Berlin there was no snow.

173
00:18:40,979 --> 00:18:45,264
When in 1925 it was called (?)

174
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:52,898
that it's necessary to trade with the West, to buy cars and industrialize (do/engage in industrialization?) the country,

175
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:58,314
all higher-educated people, members of the party, were sent to work abroad.

176
00:18:58,434 --> 00:19:05,255
And father, a certified (?) engineer who knew German fluently,

177
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:14,624
had to resign from the Ministry of Education and go to Berlin to work as a deputy of Nikolay Krestinsky,

178
00:19:14,744 --> 00:19:16,604
who was a plenipotentiary/envoy (?) at that time.

179
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,063
This is how in 1925, we came to Berlin.

180
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:32,224
"Wenn du einst in spätern Jahren
dieses Büchlein wirst durchlesen,

181
00:19:32,344 --> 00:19:36,391
denk daran wie froh wir waren,
als wir Kinder noch gewesen

182
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:40,535
und mit frohem, heitren Sinn
wanderten zur Schule hin."

183
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:48,880
"If you once, in many years, read this album again,

184
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:56,484
then remember, how we were young, joyful and cheerful (?), and how happily we went to school"

185
00:20:01,463 --> 00:20:08,782
In my memory, Germany merged into one big kindergarten.

186
00:20:08,902 --> 00:20:09,979
That was childhood.

187
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:18,071
I played with dolls, dreamed to have a doll stroller, which father fundamentally did not want to buy:

188
00:20:18,191 --> 00:20:25,805
he bought a goat, but a doll stroller, as he found, was unworthy of a Soviet little girl,

189
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:28,321
too bourgeois.

190
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:39,048
During our life in Germany I turned into a German girl.

191
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:42,715
Because I went into a Polish school only in the first year,

192
00:20:43,022 --> 00:20:49,946
and then I went to a normal German highschool (?), I learned to write Gothic letters,

193
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:55,562
I glibly read children books written in Gothic letters.

194
00:20:57,237 --> 00:21:03,390
Gothic writing is very peculiar, and I thought I had forgotten it since then. But recently I found one book -- turned out I still can read it.

195
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:08,442
We had to sit putting our hands on the desk -- strict German highschool.

196
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:15,237
It was for girls only -- boys and girls studied separately at that time. There were intermissions (?), silly girly games... [this sentence is weird]

197
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,810
I liked school. I didn't have any negative emotions about it.

198
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:28,719
Everybody went somehow (?). All in all, at that time I wanted to be like everybody, to live like everybody, to merge with others (?).

199
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:32,018
In fact, that desire I had later as well, I will talk about it. ["talk about it" sounds too strict, can you think of another word?]

200
00:21:33,783 --> 00:21:36,714
Every summer we would go somewhere.

201
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:42,416
To Salzburg, Paris -- I was seven when we went to Paris for the first time.

202
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:51,856
I remember how from Paris, for some reason, father went to Nice, to the Southern beach, and mother and I -- to Biarritz.

203
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:55,967
And in the post office, mother wrote him a letter that I can remember:

204
00:21:56,427 --> 00:21:59,988
Из Москвы до Биаррица
Прилетела Лиля птицей

205
00:22:00,264 --> 00:22:03,962
И, увидев Биарриц,
От восторга пала ниц.

206
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:08,684
Не сравнить хвоста синицы
С оперением жар-птицы,

207
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,229
Так бледнеет ваша Ниццац
Пред красою Биаррица.

208
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,601
Мой совет: пора решиться
С Ниццей вам скорей проститься,

209
00:22:16,721 --> 00:22:20,438
Взяв билет до Биаррица.
Ваша Лиля-баловница.

210
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:48,627
Mother was full of humour, acting (?). She had a very strong game(?) element.

211
00:22:48,747 --> 00:22:55,399
Say, out of some disgusting renting apartment somewhere in a hotel or anywhere

212
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,956
in a flash, she would create something special:

213
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:04,305
here she'd slip on a silk scarf, there she'd rearrange, move something,

214
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:08,647
she'd buy some <small> vase with flowers, and at once everything revived.

215
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:15,660
У нее был дар интерьера, желание видеть вокруг себя красивые вещи — и шутить.

216
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:21,015
Ну вот эпитафию такую, скажем, написала:

217
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:25,707
Умру, стихов останется тетрадка.
Заглянешь в них когда-нибудь украдкой

218
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:28,270
и скажешь: «Все же был родной котяга

219
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,326
(я маму почему-то звала кошкой, котягой)

220
00:23:30,446 --> 00:23:35,470
...Все же был родной котяга,
слегка — поэт, в душе — большой бродяга,

221
00:23:35,746 --> 00:23:41,777
лирически мяукал он и прочее
и вместо точек ставил многоточие.

222
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:51,234
И потом помню, как мы пошли на вокзал и приехал папа к нам в Биарриц, какая это была радость.

223
00:23:52,354 --> 00:23:58,981
Море, скалы, прекрасная беззаботная радостная жизнь.

224
00:23:59,319 --> 00:24:03,216
Это была жизнь как у всех.

225
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:08,240
Все куда-то уезжали летом, все потом рассказывали друг другу, где они были...

226
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:12,549
И этому наступил конец.

227
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:21,570
Всегда мы ездили на каникулы или в Швейцарию, или во Францию. Куда-нибудь.

228
00:24:21,923 --> 00:24:26,320
А тут папа решил в свой отпуск поехать в Россию,

229
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:30,540
 посмотреть, как работают машины, которые он покупал.

230
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:33,916
Мама его уговаривала не ехать.

231
00:24:34,036 --> 00:24:37,379
Она как-то боялась. Мама вообще боялась советской России,

232
00:24:37,624 --> 00:24:39,773
и в дальнейшем это скажется на нашей судьбе.

233
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:45,481
Раздался телефонный звонок, и какой-то человек попросил свидания с папой.

234
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:49,897
Папа хотел узнать, кто это, человек ответил:

235
00:24:50,017 --> 00:24:52,444
«Я должен остаться для вас инкогнито».

236
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:54,547
Папа отказался с ним встречаться.

237
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:59,616
Через два дня он снова позвонил и сказал, что «речь идет о благополучии и жизни вашей семьи».

238
00:24:59,736 --> 00:25:02,286
Ну, папа с ним встретился в кафе после этого.

239
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:10,145
И тот человек, русский, папе не знакомый, не назвавшись, сказал:

240
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:13,889
«Вы не должны ехать в Россию, вас оттуда назад не выпустят».
